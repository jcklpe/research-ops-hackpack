# ResearchOps HackPack

This is a template to get started fast on ux researchOps in an organization.

It's inspired by work produced at the [VA](https://depo-platform-documentation.scrollhelp.site/research-design/) and my own notes and processes accumulated over the years.

This document is to be used by teams that are responsible for UX design and research, and it may be shared with stakeholders to ensure that everyone has a clear understanding of how UX research is managed within the organization.

The purpose of a researchOps repo is to provide a clear and concise overview of the key elements of UX operations, including the roles and responsibilities of different team members, the tools and processes used to manage UX activities, any relevant policies or guidelines that must be followed, and to operationalize those standard operating processes through smart use of Github project management features. By providing this information in a central location, the README can help to ensure that everyone involved in UX operations has the information they need to effectively collaborate and contribute to the success of the product or service.
