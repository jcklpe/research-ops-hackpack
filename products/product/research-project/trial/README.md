# Example Trial
A trial is an individual iteration of a larger research project. Each trial is made up of a collection of the following docs:

## Trial brief
A trial brief is a detailed document that outlines the procedures and protocols for conducting a research trial.

A trial brief typically includes information about the research question, the project design, the inclusion and exclusion criteria for participants, the project schedule, the primary and secondary outcomes, and the data analysis plan. It also includes details about the project's management and oversight, including the roles and responsibilities of the research team, the monitoring plan, and the reporting and dissemination of results. The trial brief is an important tool for ensuring that the clinical trial is conducted in a rigorous and ethical manner, and that the results are reliable and valid.

## Trial Plan
A trial plan is a document that provides a structure and framework for conducting interviews or other forms of user research. In the context of a User Interview UX research trial project, a trial plan might include a list of questions or topics to be covered during the interview, as well as any prompts or probes that the researcher can use to elicit more detailed or specific responses from the participants. The trial plan can also include instructions for the researcher on how to conduct the interview, such as how to introduce the topic and how to record the responses. A Survey might have a trial plan that lists out the questions that will be asked and the response types available to the user. It migh also include a direct link to the form if it's hoste digitally such as in Google Forms, Survey Monkey, or Microsoft Forms. 

By providing a clear and consistent structure for the interviews and surveys, the trial plan can help to ensure that the research is conducted in a standardized and unbiased manner, and that the data collected is reliable and valid.

## Trial Report
Trial report is a document that summarizes the key takeaways and evidence gleaned from a research trial. It should form a useful form of documentation as well as being friendly enough as a "shareout" for stakeholders.
