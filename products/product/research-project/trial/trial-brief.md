# Trial brief for {Team, Product, Date}
**Primary Observer:** your point of contact for this trial
**Additional Observers:** who else is planning on joining on the sessions, writing notes, etc.

## Background
Briefly describe the background of your product. Consider:
- What problem is your product trying to solve?
- Where is your product situated in relation to the broader product ecosystem?
- What is User's familiarity with this tool? Is this a new product or an iteration on an existing one?

*Pro tip: Limit 3 goals per trial. If you have more than 3 goals, consider how to break up your research into additional trials.*

### Outcome
How will this research advance your product to the next phase in the design process? What will you do with your learnings?

### Hypothesis
What do you intend to learn and measure from this project? Think through these prompts to develop a strong hypothesis.
- What do you already know about this problem space?
- What do you think users will do or think about this product? (Identifying our assumptions helps us be aware of biases we may unintentionally bring into the project, so donâ€™t skip this step!)
- Write a generalized statement that combines what you know + what you think will happen during the project.
- Remember to constrain the hypothesis to the goals of your project!

## Methodology

Examples of common research methods include:

1. User interviews: This involves speaking with individual users to understand their needs, behaviors, and motivations.
2. User surveys: This involves using a survey tool to gather data from a larger group of users. Surveys can be used to collect both quantitative and qualitative data.
3. User testing: This involves observing users as they interact with a product or service, and collecting data on their behavior and feedback. This work is qualitative and may overlap with user interviews.
4. Usability testing: This involves testing a product or service to assess its usability, or how easy it is for users to accomplish their goals.
5. A/B testing: This involves presenting two versions of a product or service to two groups of users, and comparing the results to see which version is more effective.
6. Card sorting: This involves asking users to organize a set of ideas or items into categories, and analyzing their responses to understand how they think about the information.
7. Contextual inquiry: This involves observing users in their natural environment, and collecting data on their behavior and the context in which they use a product or service.
8. Eye tracking: This involves using specialized software or hardware to track the movements of users' eyes, and analyzing the data to understand what they are looking at and how they are interacting with a product or service.
9. Focus groups: This involves bringing together a small group of users to discuss a product or service, and collecting data on their opinions and feedback.
10. Tree testing: This involves presenting users with a tree-like structure representing the organization of a website or app, and collecting data on how they navigate and use the structure.
