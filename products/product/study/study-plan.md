*Pro tip: Limit 3 goals per research study. If you have more than 3 goals, consider how to break up your research into  trials.*

### Outcome
How will this research advance your product to the next phase in the design process? What will you do with your learnings?

### Hypothesis
What do you intend to learn and measure from this study? Think through these prompts to develop a strong hypothesis.
- What do you already know about this problem space?
- What do you think users will do or think about this product? (Identifying our assumptions helps us be aware of biases we may unintentionally bring into the study, so donâ€™t skip this step!)
- Write a generalized statement that combines what you know + what you think will happen during the study.
- Remember to constrain the hypothesis to the goals of your study!
