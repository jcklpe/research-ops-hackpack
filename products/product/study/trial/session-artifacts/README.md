# Session Artifacts

A session artifact is a physical object or document that is collected or generated during the course of the research study trial. Session artifacts can include a wide range of items:

## Field Notes
Field notes are the docs made to log notes for each research session or interview. They can be annotated conversation guides, or free form scratch notes. Do not allow yourself to be too precious. Artifacts are not final documentation, they are the raw material, and unedited/scattered documentation can provide a more holistic insight into the research than a streamlined document that omits whatever tangents popped up.

Field notes should be logged on a per observer basis, so if there are multiple observers they should each log their own separate field notes docs.

## Session Transcripts
Session transcripts are verbatim records of the conversations and interactions that take place during a research study. You can use open source and self hosted tools like [oTranscribe](https://otranscribe.com/opensource/) to generate these transcripts automatically.

## Audio/Video Recordings
In some cases, audio and video recordings of research sessions may not be recommended for privacy reasons. However, even if these recordings cannot be publicly shared, it can be helpful to provide a link to secure cloud repositories where the recordings are stored. If it is not possible to include the recordings in the research repository, they can be linked to as part of the session transcript artifacts or in the field notes. Additionally, it may be necessary to link to recordings instead of including them in the repository [due to limitations on large non-text files in git](https://www.perforce.com/blog/vcs/how-git-lfs-works).

## Misc. Communication Artifacts
Artifacts produced in the process of organizing and executing the research study trial can provide useful context. Some examples of these artifacts: Emails/chat-logs with stakeholders, backchannel chats between observers, post-session summary notes, etc.

## Survey Data
Artifact collecting the total results of a survey. Since a lot of survey data is not human readable, won't fit well into a git repo, and may require admin access or have privacy concerns you can also link to the cloud version of the artifact.
