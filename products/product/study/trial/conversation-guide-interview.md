Today we're going to talk about {description of your research project}.

Before we start, a few things I want to mention:

- This entire session should take about {time}.
- In this session, we want to hear your honest opinions.
- We are not testing your ability or performance. We want to improve these tools. We will not be offended by any opinions you express. We want to hear the bad, the good, everything.
- If for any reason and at any time you want to stop the session, please let me know.
- Request permission to record session.
- Confirm on camera that they have consented to being recorded.
- Admit any other observers to the video conference session and ask them to briefly introduce themselves, on camera, and then turn off their cameras.

## Warm-up Questions (Optional)

Before we look at the website, letâ€™s start with a few warm-up questions.

*Background info about the participant should have been provided by Coordinator already, so use this time to ask any other questions that you feel will help with the session.*

## Main Questions

- List questions here.
- I recommend you keep things bulleted and concise to make it easy to annotate the responses to the guide in the field notes.
    - You can nest follow up questions and responses like this to help keep the subject matter structure clear.

## Thank-You and Closing

- Thank the participant for their time, give them time to ask any questions or feedback they may have briefly, and provide them with information on how they can follow up (usually by email) if they have any further questions or feedback.
