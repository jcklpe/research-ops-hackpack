# Example Trial
A trial is an individual iteration of a larger research project. Each trial is made up of a collection of the following docs:

## Trial Plan
A trial plan is a detailed document that outlines the procedures and protocols for conducting a research trial.

A trial plan typically includes information about the research question, the study design, the inclusion and exclusion criteria for participants, the study schedule, the primary and secondary outcomes, and the data analysis plan. It also includes details about the study's management and oversight, including the roles and responsibilities of the research team, the monitoring plan, and the reporting and dissemination of results. The trial plan is an important tool for ensuring that the clinical trial is conducted in a rigorous and ethical manner, and that the results are reliable and valid.

## Conversation Guide
A conversation guide is a document that provides a structure and framework for conducting interviews or other forms of user research. In the context of a UX research trial study, a conversation guide might include a list of questions or topics to be covered during the interview, as well as any prompts or probes that the researcher can use to elicit more detailed or specific responses from the participants. The conversation guide can also include instructions for the researcher on how to conduct the interview, such as how to introduce the topic and how to record the responses. By providing a clear and consistent structure for the interviews, the conversation guide can help to ensure that the research is conducted in a standardized and unbiased manner, and that the data collected is reliable and valid.

## Trial Findings
Trial findings is a document that summarizes the key takeaways and evidence gleaned from a research trial. It should form a useful form of documentation as well as being friendly enough as a "shareout" for stakeholders.
